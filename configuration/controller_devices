# IAS 0.1 controller devices configuration.
# -----------------------------------------
#
# This the the IAS controller configuration file.
# In this file you will specify the unique device identifiers with the
# processes which need to be called by the system to initiate a device process.
#
# Example:
#
# device0
# /usr/bin/python3 /home/ias/scripts/weather.py [arguments]
#
# The first line indicates the device identifier, this way the controller knows
# what devices are allowed to connect. Note that the device process needs to
# authenticate itself with the controller service.
#
# The next line indicates the process which needs to be called by the
# system (with possible arguments).
